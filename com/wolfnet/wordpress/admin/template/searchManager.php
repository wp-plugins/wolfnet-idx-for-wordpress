		<p>The <strong>Search Manager</strong> allows you to create and save custom searches for use
			in shortcodes and widgets. The WordPress Search Manager works much the same way as the
			URL Search Builder within the MLSFinder Admin.</p>

		<p>Custom searches can target any of the search criteria that is available on your property
			search. Keep in mind that some search criteria is more restrictive than others, which
			means less results will be produced. Use the <strong>Results</strong> feature to
			determine how restrictive a search may be. NOTE: the search criteria available on your
			property search is based on the data available in the feed from your MLS. This data is
			subject to change, which may affect custom search strings you generate. WolfNet
			recommends that you periodically review your custom searches to verify that they still
			produce the expected results. If not, you may need to revisit the search manager and
			create a new custom search.</p>
